# Translations

Here you can find all the translations for [AutoMod](https://github.com/xezzz/AutoMod). Inside the ``lang_LANG.json.example`` you can find all the strings the bot uses. 
However, not that it only contains the keys. In order for the bot to actually parse them, some of the strings contain important arguments, e.g. ``{user}``. 
If you want to know which ones are needed, check out the ``en_US.json`` file inside the ``i18n`` directory of this repo.
